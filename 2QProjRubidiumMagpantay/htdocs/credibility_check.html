	<!--Introduction Text-->
	<div class="body_text">
		<h3 style="font-weight:400; font-size: 20px">Nowadays, almost anyone could just go online and upload any information they want to. There is no security and confirmation that the info you found is true. As such, it is very important to check the credibility of your sources. Here are some importants elements to look for in a credible source:</h3>
	</div>

	<!--Section 1-->
	<div class="body_text">
		<h2>1. Authorship</h2>
		<p>The author of the article/source is normally stated on the webpage. Sources with anonymous authors have less credibility. He/she must be credible - meaning that he/she is qualified to write about the topic-at-hand. These credentials are very important in scholarly and academic works. <b>The author can generally be found at either the beginning or end of the article.</b></p>

	</div>

	<!--Section 2-->
	<div class="body_text">
		<h2>2. Publisher</h2>
		<p>The publisher refers to the origin of the article/source. A credible publisher should be widely-known, reputable, and trustworthy. Some examples of credible publishers include: government websites (e.g.psa.gov.ph), online journals (e.g. sciencedirect.com), renowned organizations (e.g. unicef.org), news publishers (e.g. edition.cnn.com), and academic institutions (e.g. upd.edu.ph). Check the domain of the website (e.g. .gov, .edu, etc.). The .gov and .edu domains are reserved for government institutions and academic institutions, respectively. Be cautious of other domains like .com, .org, and .net for these can be used by any individual. <b>The publisher can generally be found at the top of the webpage.</b></p>

	</div>

	<!--Section 3-->
	<div class="body_text">
		<h2>3. Date</h2>
		<p>The date when the article/source was published or last-updated must always be checked. Identify when it was created and how recently it was updated. Outdated information could be wrong, misleading, or obsolete. Moreover, this element is also very important in citation. The general rule-of-thumb is that credible sources must be at most from 10 years ago. <b>The date of publication can normally be found at either the beginning or end of the article.</b></p>
		<img class="center" src="../images/p2_date.png" alt="Date Example" title="Date Example. Screenshot taken from ScienceDirect." width="80%" style="margin-top:15px;">
		<p class="alt_text">Finding the date of publication will help in assessing credibility. (Screenshot taken from ScienceDirect)</p>
	</div>

	<!--Section 4-->
	<div class="body_text">
		<h2>4. References</h2>
		<p> Credible sources would have cited references of their own. This may come in the form of bibliographic citations (e.g. APA format), footnotes, links to other websites, or in-line citations. Evaluate the sourcesâ€™ references credibility. If these references are credible, then the original source would have much more credibility. <b>The references can generally be found at the end of the page or within the article itself.</b><p>
		<img class="center" src="../images/p2_sources.png" alt="References Example" title="References Example. Screenshot taken from ScienceDirect." width="80%" style="margin-top:15px;">
		<p class="alt_text">Most reference sections can be found at the end of articles. (Screenshot taken from ScienceDirect)</p>
	</div>

	<!--Section 5-->
	<div class="body_text">
		<h2>5. Site Design and Writing Style</h2>
		<p> Although this is subjective, a well-designed website could indicate credibility. However, this is the least substantial aspect and should be the last one to check. There are many examples of credible sources that do not have extravagant designs. Moreover, check the writing style of the article. If the article is full of syntax or grammatical errors, it could indicate that it is not reliable. <b>This aspect is entirely up for the user to judge.</b></p>
		<img class="center"src="../images/p2_design.png" alt="Design Example" title="Design Example. Screenshot taken from ScienceDirect." width="80%" style="margin-top:15px;">
		<p class="alt_text">The grammar and layout design of a website also contribute to credibility. (Screenshot taken from ScienceDirect)</p>
	</div>

	<!--Closing Remarks-->
	<div class="body_text">
		<h3 style="font-weight:400; font-size: 20px">Look out for these elements when you are looking over an online source. Take note, however, that a reference does not have to necessarily contain all of these aspects in order to be considered credible. <b>Use your best judgement and remain skeptical.</b></h3>
